## Logic Circuits :
- Simple circuit is "Not" and there are more like "AND" ,"OR" ,"NAND" ,"NOR" ,"XOR" and "XNOR".
by using these simple circuits you can made complex ones (8 Bit-adder)and tht called logic gates .

# What is make computer ?
## Computers to do these 4 things :
* INPUT.
* STORAGE.
* PROCESS.
* OUTPUT

## What is The Bit :
- Is a smallest unit of information can computer store ,it can be (1 or 0) only there is not third choice.

### Difference between Decimal and Binary systems:
- **Decimal system** : consist numbers from 0 to 9.
- **Binary system** : consist only 0 and 1.
- So by using _binary system_ you can represent _decimal system_ but we need more bits to do it ,Ex: by using 8 bits you can count from 0 until 255.
- Pictures , images , videos and all graphics things made up from tiny dots called **pixel** .
